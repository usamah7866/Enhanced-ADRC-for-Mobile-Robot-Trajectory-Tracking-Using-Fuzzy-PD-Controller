# Enhanced-ADRC-for-Mobile-Robot-Trajectory-Tracking-Using-Fuzzy-PD-Controller
An enhanced  ADRC framework by replacing the traditional PD controller with a Fuzzy PD (FPD) controller. Unlike classical PD, the  FPD controller utilizes fuzzy logic to dynamically adjust the proportional gain based on the systemâ€™s error, allowing for  improved adaptability and disturbance rejection.
